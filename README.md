# TGS_Salt_Identify_Kaggle-ImgSeg-DL
This is a Kaggle competition on Image Segmentation. We have to identify pixels in seismic images with salt sediment present. Here I will use UNet (Encoder and Decoder) to tackle the challenge.

## Attempt History
1. Simple Unet with VGG as encoder and decoder.
2.
